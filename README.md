# Amstrad CPC DSK Info Tool

## Created by Jason Brooks - www.muckypaws.com - www.muckypawslabs.com

**Welcome to my little project.**

Recently I've been looking at protection systems of old.  The Community have done an amazing job in digital preservation, looking at ways to archive tapes and disks.

The Amstrad CPC disks are usually identified with the DSK file format, though I have no doubt the ZX Spectrum and others will also use something similar.

The DSK File format is very well documented, and Emulation tools do an amazing job of emulating the subtle nuances these disks posed when certain copy protection techniques were used.

Whilst looking at Emulation vs Real Hardware, I was discovering some anomalies, were these a quirk of emulation or actually physically present on the real thing.

I found myself looking at the internals of these DSK Image files, and needed to speed up looking at bits of information rather than processing through a Hex Editor.

And so this little project is born... 

It's not very exciting at the moment, and I've written it in Python3 to ensure maximum compatibility.  Though I'm still very much a novice at Python Coding... Frankly it seems more complicated than Z80 Assembly...

The code is provided as-is, though if you feel you can contribute to the project, then all is welcome.  Especially anyone who can actually code in Python... 

This is just the beginning but the tool can become much more.

Ideas include...

Ability to extract file from the AMSDOS file format to your device.  IE. Enumerate the file systems files and extract the data direct your filesystem for whatever puposes you decide.

Inject files to the disk.
Convert the DSK from CPM Format to Data, even possibly extract game code from protected disks.

But there are all flights of fancy for another day.

It's very basic right now and probably buggy...

How to use it?

You'll need a Python3 environment either in Windows, macOS, Linux and of course access to DSK Files.

Currently only shows two things.
